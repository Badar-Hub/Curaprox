        Space-filling, effective and gentle: CURAPROX interdental brushes clean the
        entire critical interdental space effectively and without injury: from the
        gum line over the concave niches to right under the contact point. Even the
        tiniest interdental spaces are dealt with without risk of injury – thanks to
        CURAL®, the ultra-thin and extra strong surgical wire that makes a single
        cleaning movement sufficient: once in and out. Done.

          CPS prime – the finest little brushes on the market with unparalleled
          durability. CPS 06 prime is the smallest interdental brush of all and
          can even fit into very narrow gaps. The click system means that personal,
          favourite holders can be used for the particularly easy and effective
          prevention of caries in the side teeth, gingivitis and periodontitis.
          The quality of CPS prime makes a single cleaning movement sufficient:

        <p>
          It’s so easy to determine the correct interdental brush – and so
          fast and safe: your dental professional measures the interdental
          space with the patented IAP probe. He or she will then advise on
          which brush to use where by supplying the patient with their own
          CURAPROX IAC chart.
        </p>
        <P style="display:list-item">
          Colour coding: the colour still showing when using the IAC probe indicates the size of the corresponding CPS prime interdental brush you will require for that interdental space.

        <h2>Special little brushes: CPS strong & implant and CPS soft implant</h2>
        <p>
          Spaces are much larger than usual after periodontal treatment
          and implants. With its fine, long bristles, a CPS soft implant brush
          is ideally suited to the gentle cleaning of large spaces. The
          stronger version CPS strong & implant is ideal for the special care
          needed with implants and bridges. Bent into a crescent shape, they
          are especially effective with side pressure.

        <h2>Why do we actually need interdental brushes?</h2>
        <p>Because normal brushes can only reach two thirds of a tooth’s 
           surface. Toothbrushes clean the outsides, insides and tops of the
           teeth. But what about the sides of the teeth and the gum line 
           between the teeth? They cannot be reached by any toothbrush 
           and often not even by dental floss. Caries of the side teeth, 
           inflammation and periodontitis can thus be caused and develop 
           unhindered until teeth fall out. Preventing this however is easy: 
           dentists recommend cleaning the interdental spaces once a day, 
           best of all in the evening before brushing the teeth. This removes 
           plaque between the teeth.
        </p>
       <p>
         Left: The critical areas are inaccessible not only for toothbrushes 
         but usually even for dental floss. Dental floss stretches over the 
         concave areas that need cleaning. However, dental floss can be highly 
         suitable for the front teeth.
       </p>
       <p>
         Middle: Interdental brushes with bristles that are too short. 
         Failing to fill the space, they have little or no effect. Gum 
         inflammation takes its course – and can turn into periodontitis. 
         Tooth loss becomes inevitable.
       </p>
       <p>
         Right: Correct: A CPS prime fills the gap between the teeth 
         completely, removing plaque from all the critical niches and the
         gum line – gently and effectively in a single cleaning movement.
